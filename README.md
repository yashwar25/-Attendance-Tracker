# 🏫 Blockchain Attendance Tracker

## 📘 Project Vision

The Blockchain Attendance Tracker is an innovative decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize attendance management using blockchain technology. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, we aim to create a transparent, tamper-proof, and efficient system for tracking attendance across various contexts.

## ✨ Key Features

- Decentralized attendance logging
- Immutable attendance records
- Transparent event management
- Secure and verifiable attendance tracking
- No central authority required
